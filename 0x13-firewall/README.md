Alright, let's break it down:

#Port 22 (SSH):
Imagine you have a secret door in your treehouse. Port 22 is like the secret code you need to open that door. But this door isn't just any door; it's super secure! Only your closest friends who know the secret code (or password) can enter. SSH (Secure Shell) is like the magic spell that keeps this door locked tight, making sure only the right people can come in and hang out in your awesome treehouse.

#Port 443 (HTTPS SSL): 
Picture a special tunnel that connects your treehouse to your friend's treehouse across the forest. Port 443 is like the entrance to that tunnel. But here's the cool part: this tunnel is super safe and private. It's like there's a magical shield around it that keeps everything you send and receive inside the tunnel safe from prying eyes. That's HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) making sure your messages and secrets are protected as they travel through the tunnel.

#Port 80 (HTTP): 
Now, imagine your treehouse has a big window with a cute little mailbox next to it. Port 80 is like that mailbox. It's where all your friends can drop off notes, drawings, or anything else they want to share with you. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is like the friendly mailman who checks your mailbox and delivers all those fun messages and pictures to you inside your treehouse. It's the way your friends can easily send stuff to you over the internet.
